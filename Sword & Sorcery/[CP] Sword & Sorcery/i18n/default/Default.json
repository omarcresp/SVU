  "Core.Mateo.CCMinecart": "Now that you've got the minecarts back up, things must be so much easier on you.$14#$b#Even with a horse, you've still got so much ground to cover. Great job, @.$1",
  "Core.Mateo.CCComplete": "The Community Center's looking fantastic! And that was all your handiwork, @? $1#$b#Incredible. You've done an amazing job! It's great to see it being used again.$80",
  "Core.Mateo.MovieTheater": "Wanna go see a flick, @? It's my treat, since you're the one who went through all the trouble to rebuild from those ruins.$1#$b#Nothing does your arteries as good as an evening full of Flavacol popcorn!$32",

  // BIRTHDAYS
  "Core.Mateo.Winter12": "It's Gunther's birthday today. He's the type that I have no clue how to buy for...$34#$b#What do you get the type of guy who gets himself everything? His 'to be read' list is a mile long.$21",
  "Core.Mateo.Winter19": "It's Marlon's birthday today! I have no idea what the old man would want.$8#$b#He's got access to all the best gear, so maybe something to help maintain it... maybe I'll just make him a nice dinner.$32",

  "Core.Mateo.FallEnd": "Winter's coming, huh? Can't say I'm looking forward to it, but Spring will come back to us eventually.$23",

  "Core.Mateo.CommunityCenter10": "Good to see you here, @. Just doing the rounds and catching up with everyone.$14#$b#Sometimes it's hard to make time to see your friends, so I'm glad the townsfolk are committed to gathering together like this once a season.$1",

  "Core.Mateo.Luau": "I really appreciate the sentiment of the festival tomorrow - tradition is a really important thing, of course -$10#$b#But doesn't it just seem really short sighted to blindly throw a ton of different things into one soup? I love taking risks, but that seems a little much.$9",
  "Core.Mateo.MoonlightJelly": "Tomorrow's celebration is my second favorite, next to Spirit's Eve.$0#$b#I can see the Jellies from the cove. It's breathtaking.$12",
  "Core.Mateo.SDVFair": "The fair is tomorrow, @! Are you going to bring pumpkins?$11#$b#And...Other...important...produce?$21#$b#I'm just saying, if I was voting and it was all pumpkins, you'd win.$15",
  "Core.Mateo.SpiritsEve": "So, there are a few rules to be followed on Spirit's Eve, back from when I was a kid.$1#$b#One, always check your candy. Two, always wear a costume. Three, always have treats on hand to give out.$13#$b#Finally, never blow out a Jack o' Lantern before midnight. That's the most important one.$14",
  "Core.Mateo.IceFestival": "Festival of Ice tomorrow, huh?$14#$b#I'm not one for fishing, by any means. But I can throw a mean snowball - and, hey, if you can dodge an Iridium Bat...$15",
  "Core.Mateo.NightMarket": "Oh, that's right. The Night Market's going on.$3#$b#I forgot. Maybe I'll stop by and see if they've got anything from Gotoro for sale. Someone's bound to have smuggled in something interesting, huh?$36",
  "Core.Mateo.WinterStar": "There's so much pressure for the Feast of the Winter Star.$22#$b#I don't know what to get anyone! Except you, Marlon and Gunther... Guess it's not just the gifts, but the spirit of the season.$23",

  "Core.Mateo.StardropGiftB": "Morning, Sunshine! You won't believe what I found in the Skull Cave.$1#$b#I know it'll put an extra pep in your step, and you work so hard - you deserve it.$32#$b#Have an amazing day, okay?$11#$b#%Mateo leans forward and kisses your forehead.",

  "Core.Mateo.Reject2HA": "No thanks, farmer. I don't want the town coming after you with torches and pitchforks.$24",
  "Core.Mateo.Reject2HB": "Farmer, do you know what a bad idea looks like? This, it looks like this right here.$10",
  "Core.Mateo.Reject4HA": "@, I appreciate this, and I appreciate you, but it's a no for now - I have to work on myself first.$21",
  "Core.Mateo.Reject4HB": "Sorry, @. I can't. It'll be a mess for the both of us. I'm not ready for a relationship and the last thing I want to do is hurt my closest friend.$16",
  "Core.Mateo.EngageA": "...Aren't you betrothed? I'm not into this. And I didn't think you were the disingenuous sort.$34",
  "Core.Mateo.EngageB": "Your wedding is in a few days, and this is how you're acting? I should tell your spouse, lest you break their heart.$22",
  "Core.Mateo.MarriedA": "This kind of stuff comes back around to haunt you, @. What comes around goes around. Your spouse deserves better.$23",
  "Core.Mateo.MarriedB": "The hell is wrong with you, @? Your partner deserves better. I didn't expect a cheater out of you.$33",
  "Core.Mateo.RefusalNoHeartsA": "The mermaid pendant tradition goes back centuries. Good for whoever you're giving it to.$32",
  "Core.Mateo.RefusalNoHeartsB": "We had a pretty different tradition in the Fern Islands. This is very cute, though - good luck!$32",
  "Core.Mateo.RefusalKnownA": "This would be cute if it wasn't so weird. Thanks but no thanks, I guess?$34",
  "Core.Mateo.RefusalKnownB": "You're really looking to get into some trouble, huh? I'm flattered, sort of. But no.$37",
  "Core.Mateo.RefusalBotherA": "It wasn't funny or cute the first time, what makes you think this is any better?$22",
  "Core.Mateo.RefusalBotherB": "Cut it out, @. It takes a lot to get here but you're crossing a line into making me uncomfortable.$23",

  // RESORT
  "Core.Mateo.ResortEntering": "This place is amazing! It makes me feel like I'm back in the Fern Islands. Man, how nostalgic.$1",
  "Core.Mateo.ResortLeaving": "Today was a good day, but I've had my fill. Nothing beats a post-beach shower. Gotta wash all the sunscreen off.$0",
  "Core.Mateo.ResortShore": "I've visited a lot of different islands, @. But one thing to keep in mind: all of them share the same sky.$4",
  "Core.Mateo.ResortUmbrella": "Just taking a little break from running around, @. Be sure to put on some sunscreen if you're going to spend a lot of time out and about.$32",
  "Core.Mateo.ResortWander": "I know I live on a beach, but there's still something special about visiting a different one.$1",
  "Core.Mateo.ResortWander.2": "I need a good pair of sunglasses. The big ones, that the bougie city girls wear.$35",
  "Core.Mateo.ResortChair": "I could probably fall asleep here, but I snooze like a rock and I'd probably miss the boat back.$6",
  "Core.Mateo.ResortBar": "We should toast to your hard work, @. Without you, this wouldn't have been set up.$12",
  "Core.Mateo.ResortTowel": "%Mateo seems completely relaxed.",
  "Core.Mateo.ResortTowel.2": "I spent many a day in college drinking at the beach instead of writing papers...$15",
  "Core.Mateo.Resort_Towel.3": "This would be a great place to have a party.$13",
  "Core.Mateo.Resort": "Did you build a house here, @? A home away from home. Nice!$1",

  // ADDITIONAL LOCATIONAL DIALOGUE
  "Core.Mateo.Saloon.4h": "It's so nice to be back here, @. I love being around people. Everyone's so jovial and it's so easy to feel relaxed right alongside them. I feel welcome, and whole.$4",
  "Core.Mateo.Saloon.6h": "I love spending time here because it's a great way to see everyone at once. People watching is a lot of fun...$0#$b#Demetrius has two left feet, and Marnie is way too good for Lewis. I wish Marlon would work up the courage to make a move.$36",
  "Core.Mateo.Saloon.8h": "There's no better way to spend an evening than among friends. I'm so glad you convinced me it was worth re-integrating, @. I love hanging out with everyone.$12#$b#I owe you a drink. Hell, I owe you a few.$14",
  "Core.Mateo.Saloon.10h.Platonic": "Hey, @. How about you and I hang out a while? You probably need some r&r after a long day. Some time to rest is earned.$1",
  "Core.Mateo.Saloon.10h.Romantic": "Hey, Sunshine. How about you and I have a few drinks and get a little bit slovenly? Thank goodness the farm isn't that far off, if we even make it there.$31",

  "Core.Mateo.ArchaeologyHouse.4h": "It's so nostalgic in here... it's like spending time in my childhood home.$12#$b#I didn't realize how badly I missed this place until I came back to it.$32",
  "Core.Mateo.ArchaeologyHouse.6h": "Haven't read for leisure in a really long time, so I'm starting over with some of my favorites.#$b#Having to read for school really sucks the fun out of it.",
  "Core.Mateo.ArchaeologyHouse.8h": "I love watching everyone come in and out, learning, reading, relaxing. Nothing makes me happier than seeing folks engage with academia.$32#$b#Especially the kids; they're all so eager to learn, and I love that. Bless Penny and her neverending patience.$1",
  "Core.Mateo.ArchaeologyHouse.10h.Platonic": "I know you're busy @, but a good book is worth making time for. I'm re-reading The Great Gatsbish, it's one of my favorites.$4",
  "Core.Mateo.ArchaeologyHouse.10h.Romantic": "I'm re-reading the Great Gatsbish; it's my comfort book. I've always related deeply to it, like it was the script for how my life was supposed to play out, but...$2#$b#Gats got caught in the tide of his own misguided vision, and couldn't row forward. But I don't identify so much with his struggle anymore, because I was able to leave the past where it belonged.$12#$b#That doesn't mean I love the novel any less. But maybe I should start looking for a new favorite.$32",

  "Core.Mateo.AdventureGuild.4h": "Hail and well met, adventurer! Gosh, that sounds cheesy, doesn't it?$1",
  "Core.Mateo.AdventureGuild.6h": "Hail and well met, adventurer!$1#$b#Hah, that's really growing on me. Though maybe I should leave the greetings to Marlon.$32",
  "Core.Mateo.AdventureGuild.8h": "Hey there, @! Hail and well met. Here to get some new equipment? Or maybe offload some old stuff?$36#$b#Marlon's got you covered. Stay safe down below, alright?$32",
  "Core.Mateo.AdventureGuild.10h.Platonic": "Hey, @, hail and well met. Are you doing a little exploring? Have you got everything you need?$32#$b#Are your weapons taken care of? Just stay safe down there, all right? Be careful.$1",
  "Core.Mateo.AdventureGuild.10h.Romantic": "Hail and well met, Sunshine! Have you got everything you need? Are your weapons taken care of?$31#$b#Stay safe if you're heading down into the mines, alright? I love you.$29",

  "Core.Mateo.PlayerKilled.Mines.02": "Sunshine, what happened? I'm so sorry!",
  "Core.Mateo.PlayerKilled.Mines.03": "Please be more careful! Even skilled adventurers like yourself can get seriously hurt!$2#$b#Maybe go home and get some rest before heading back down, okay?$21",

  "Core.Mateo.PlayerKilled.Skull.01": " ... @?",
  "Core.Mateo.PlayerKilled.Skull.02": "Easy, now... take it slow.",
  "Core.Mateo.PlayerKilled.Skull.03": "You're awake! Thank goodness. Mateo found you all bent out of shape in the Skull Cave!$2",
  "Core.Mateo.PlayerKilled.Skull.04": "Sunshine!$18#$b#I was so worried, you getting hurt is my worst nightmare!$19",
  "Core.Mateo.PlayerKilled.Skull.05": "{{CPPNI}} {{LPPN1}} going to be alright, Harv?$29",
  "Core.Mateo.PlayerKilled.Skull.06": "{{CPPN1}}'ll be fine, but {{LPPN1}}'ll need to be a little more careful next time.$2",
  "Core.Mateo.PlayerKilled.Skull.07": "I'll leave you two to talk; let me know if you need anything.$2",
  "Core.Mateo.PlayerKilled.Skull.08": "I was so afraid of losing you, @. I don't know what I'd do without my best friend, the love of my life.$17#$b#Please ask for help if you need it next time, Sunshine! I'd rather be in danger with you than have you go at the Skull Cave alone!$19",

  // GREEN RAIN
  "Core.Mateo.GreenRain": "I've never seen rain like this before, even with all the time I spent in Pelican Town as a kid. I hope it's a good omen.$37",
  "Core.Mateo.GreenRainFinished": "The rain was pretty intense, but it didn't seem to have any negative side effects. Everything is so lush right now!$1",
  "Core.Mateo.GreenRain2": "Something tells me Hector has something to do with the weird rain. What do you think, @?$14",

  // POLYAMORY 
  "Core.Mateo.MarriedMonogamousNPC": "Sorry, @! I'm flattered, but you're with a monogamous partner, so I'd be intruding on the rules of your relationship.$16",

  // SEASONAL EARLY HEART 
  // SPRING
  "Core.Mateo.Spring.EarlyHeart.1": "Hey, farmer. What do you call an emergency in the Spring? May Day.$14",
  "Core.Mateo.Spring.EarlyHeart.2": "It's getting warmer out. You can tell by the Spring in folks' step.$14",
  "Core.Mateo.Spring.EarlyHeart.3": "What do you grow, anyway? Parsnips, potatoes, what else? I'm not the agricultural sort.$0",
  "Core.Mateo.Spring.EarlyHeart.4": "What did the florist say during springtime, @? $1#$b#Business is blooming.$32",
  "Core.Mateo.Spring.EarlyHeart.5": "Watch out, farmer. Wilderness Golems get particularly ornery in the Spring, in the case they turn up on your land.$34#$b#At least they're easier to manage than Stone Golems - there's two types of those, keep an eye out for the sturdier ones. They're bigger, with horns.$9",
  "Core.Mateo.Spring.EarlyHeart.6": "Spring must be really busy for you. Lots of work to do. Be sure to take it easy on occasion, you owe it to yourself.$24",
  "Core.Mateo.Spring.EarlyHeart.7": "Are you a sword, hammer, or dagger sort of person?$0#$b#I'm good with a longsword, but I'm better with a pair of daggers. Be sure to maintenance any weapons you used over the Winter.$1",
  "Core.Mateo.Spring.EarlyHeart.8": "It's a good time of year to look for fossils, if you're interested in that sort of thing. Crabs and frogs, specifically, seem really common around here.$36",
  "Core.Mateo.Spring.EarlyHeart.9": "Hey @! I found this down below, can you get it to Gunther for me? Thanks! [117 118 119 120 110 111 112]$14",
  "Core.Mateo.Spring.EarlyHeart.10": "Some hot chocolate would be great right now. The best I can do in the tent is a hot plate- anything else would be a fire hazard.$16#$b#I don't keep a lot of food in there at a time lest any wild critters break in.$8",
  "Core.Mateo.Spring.EarlyHeart.11": "Hey, farmer. Have a good day today, alright? Keep your chin up.$0",
  "Core.Mateo.Spring.EarlyHeart.12": "Seen anything interesting on your adventures lately, @? I'd love to hear about what you're up to.$0",
  "Core.Mateo.Spring.EarlyHeart.13": "Please excuse my resting beach face, farmer. $15",
  "Core.Mateo.Spring.EarlyHeart.14": "Hey, farmer. Hope you're doing alright. Keep working hard, but not too hard.$1",
  "Core.Mateo.Spring.EarlyHeart.15": "The trader out in the desert has these artifact troves; they've got things like Dwarven Gadgets and other relics inside.$34#$b#I'm not sure how it's all being sourced, though. I know the woman in the traveling cart gets her goods from Gotoro, which is...extremely risky.$37",
  "Core.Mateo.Spring.EarlyHeart.16": "Hope you're doing alright since that little encounter with those slimes.$32",

  // SUMMER
  "Core.Mateo.Summer.EarlyHeart.1": "Hey, farmer. It's really humid out... be careful, stay hydrated.$0",
  "Core.Mateo.Summer.EarlyHeart.2": "When the sun pervades through the tent flap in the morning, it's always worth getting up and watching it rise. There's just something about it in the summer that's particularly magical - maybe it's the way the light hits the water.$4",
  "Core.Mateo.Summer.EarlyHeart.3": "Howdy, farmer. Will I sea you on the beach this season?$14",
  "Core.Mateo.Summer.EarlyHeart.4": "It's the best time of the year to go swimming. Be careful, though. If you get scratched up by something in the caves, salt water will just irritate it.$24",
  "Core.Mateo.Summer.EarlyHeart.5": "Frost Bats have trouble surviving in humid temperatures, so you're not likely to see them up on the surface. There's several colonies of regular Fruit Bats in the Valley, though.$12",
  "Core.Mateo.Summer.EarlyHeart.6": "Did you know air conditioning was first used in movie theaters? It's part of the reason we have summertime blockbusters - people go in droves to keep cool.$1",
  "Core.Mateo.Summer.EarlyHeart.7": "I picked a scab from a wound I got fighting monsters. The one downside to wearing an open shirt, I guess. Everyone sees what a mess I make of myself.$8#$b#Some days it bothers me, and some days it doesn't. But it's never enough that I want to wear long sleeves or a closed top in the Summer.$13",
  "Core.Mateo.Summer.EarlyHeart.8": "The Metal Heads that live in the mines are a lucky sort. If they were up on the surface for a Valley summer, they'd boil in their little helmets.$9",
  "Core.Mateo.Summer.EarlyHeart.9": "It's cooler in the mines than it is on the surface right now. Pass this along for me, okay? [96 97 98 99]$14",
  "Core.Mateo.Summer.EarlyHeart.10": "It's cooler in the mines than it is on the surface right now. Pass this along for me, okay? [100 101 103]$14",
  "Core.Mateo.Summer.EarlyHeart.11": "Split a stone and found this - here you go, @! Thanks for getting it to Gunther for me. [110 111 112 117 118 119 120]$14",
  "Core.Mateo.Summer.EarlyHeart.12": "Hey, farmer. What do you say when your fishing line gets tangled? That something a-piers to be wrong.$15",
  "Core.Mateo.Summer.EarlyHeart.13": "When I first started delving as a kid, I was particularly fascinated by the Dust Sprites. Cute little things, aren't they?$12",
  "Core.Mateo.Summer.EarlyHeart.14": "Hey, @. Here's my latest find. Monsters drop the strangest things sometimes, don't they? [113 115 116]$14",
  "Core.Mateo.Summer.EarlyHeart.15": "Hey, @. Here's my latest find. Monsters drop the strangest things sometimes, don't they? [104 105 106]$14",
  "Core.Mateo.Summer.EarlyHeart.16": "I want to get more involved in the community, but I haven't worked out how yet. Maybe Marnie needs some help around the ranch.$8",

  // FALL
  "Core.Mateo.Fall.EarlyHeart.1": "Nothing beats a brisk mountain walk in the Fall. Don't you just love that crispness in the air?$4",
  "Core.Mateo.Fall.EarlyHeart.2": "I need a few more pumpkins for the tent... Once you harvest, I might buy a bunch off you.$13",
  "Core.Mateo.Fall.EarlyHeart.3": "I try to minimize how much time I spend down below during this time of year, but I did find this.[96 97 98 99 100 101 103]$14",
  "Core.Mateo.Fall.EarlyHeart.4": "Bet the farm looks amazing this time of year. Lots of sunflowers and pumpkins, right?$12",
  "Core.Mateo.Fall.EarlyHeart.5": "I really love how everything gets gold-toned this time of year. It's so nice to just wander around.$32",
  "Core.Mateo.Fall.EarlyHeart.6": "I could go for some mulled cider right now, or pumpkin spice anything, or apple pie with some ice cream...$36",
  "Core.Mateo.Fall.EarlyHeart.7": "Are you growing sunflowers? Do you cook the seeds? Oh! By the way. I found this, maybe you can donate it. [117 118 119 120]$15",
  "Core.Mateo.Fall.EarlyHeart.8": "It's just a hypothesis, but I'm convinced there's a connection between Spirit's Eve and the various Ghosts that haunt the mines; maybe they come to the surface and cause mischief...$35",
  "Core.Mateo.Fall.EarlyHeart.9": "What do you do with all the pumpkins you grow...? Oh! By the way. I found this, maybe you can donate it. [110 111 112]$14",

  "Core.Mateo.Fall.LateHeart.10": "Getting to bundle up with a fashionable coat is one of my favorite parts of Fall, and the only thing I like about Winter.$10#$b#I'm not very aesthetically forward, but I try to look nice when I can.

  "Core.Mateo.Fall.LateHeart.16": "Are you going to bring something to the Spirit's Eve celebration, @? I don't know if they do it here in the Valley, but in more densely populated areas, passing out treats is a really important part of the holiday festivities.$32",
  "Core.Mateo.Fall.LateHeart.17": "Don't blow a Jack o' Lantern out before midnight, @. They're to keep away creatures of the night. I think that myth stems all the way back from when we had to contend with monsters on the surface more often.$35#$b#It was a practice to keep them away because we naturally fear the unknown.$36",
  "Core.Mateo.Fall.LateHeart.18": "I don't think anyone ever really ages out of Spirit's Eve. It's the one time of year where you can express yourself with a costume, and I think that's good for the soul.$1#$b#It's a tradition that has existed in some form for over a thousand years, across multiple different cultures.

  "CT.Mateo.ReputationIncreased": "...Lucikiel told me a little bit about how he's working with Clint, and clearing monsters in the mines...$37#$b#I tentatively feel like I've misjudged him. He mentioned I'd make a better adventurer if I could work on my own equipment...I might look into that.$36",

  "CT.Marlon.MateoLibrary": "I heard Mateo's back around these parts... best have a chat with 'em, soon.",
  "CT.Marlon.MateoAdmission": "Gonna have to corner that kid when I get the chance, they're so damn flighty... The next time they're up this way, Gunther and I will be ready.",
  "CT.Marlon.MateoConfrontation": "Glad we were able to get that whole thing sorted with Mateo. I feel a bit bad, though. Like Gunther and I scared the pants off of 'em.",
  "CT.Marlon.MateoWyatt": "Wyatt, that old bastard... that's the power of greed for ya, I suppose.",
  "CT.Marlon.MateoAcceptance": "Another member added to our ranks. A right skilled one, too. Mateo's abilities go beyond just talent. Can't help but wonder if there's something else to 'em.",
  "CT.Marlon.MateoPain": "That fuckin' kid, going and getting themselves hurt like that... they're no amateur! What were they thinking?#$b#They'll bounce back, I'm just... worried. I've known them since they were knee high.",
  "CT.Marlon.MateoPain.Filtered": "That damn kid, going and getting themselves hurt like that... they're no amateur! What were they thinking?#$b#They'll bounce back, I'm just... worried. I've known them since they were knee high.",
  "CT.Marlon.MateoRecovery": "Mateo's back!#$b#I should get Gunther, let 'em know...#$b#Hope they're not doing too poorly.",
  "CT.Marlon.CGuildConstruction": "I'm glad Mateo's starting to pull everything together...s'bout time.#$b#Thank you for helping them.",
  "CT.Marlon.CGuildComplete": "Hey, listen. I appreciate everything you've done for Mateo...#$b#You really set them on the right path. Not nearly the straight and narrow, but... they're far better off than they were before.#$bHah! Maybe with another branch, me and Gil can really start takin' it easy. We're not youngins anymore!",
  "CT.Marlon.MateoDate": "Hm... you and Mateo, eh? ...Figured. Good for you, kids. S'abit obvious with how late you two came out of the mines.",
  "CT.Marlon.MateoIntegrity": "You n' Mateo are really coming into your own. Good for you. Keep fighting for change, kid.",
  "CT.Marlon.MateoDeclaration": "Feels a lot like I'm gonna leave this world a lot better than I found it... I'm so proud of you kids.",

He and I are going to have to have a chat with Mateo.#$b#I am not willing to take chances with the collection in progress if they have any lasting ties with their previous teacher...#$b#Lewis assured me of Mateo's character, and that the situation was very likely a result of manipulation on Wyatt's part... but I need to make a judgment for myself.",
  "CT.Gunther.MateoConfrontation": "I hoped for the best, and it would appear that it worked out. Mateo's more well-read than I expected, hardly the criminal a man like Wyatt would've raised them to be.#$b#I think they'll make a fine addition to the academic community; I'm looking forward to whatever contributions they look to make.",
  "CT.Gunther.MateoWyatt": "I misjudged Mateo. I'm grateful everything seems to be worked out.",
  "CT.Gunther.MateoAcceptance": "It was good of Marlon to take Mateo under his wing, though they hardly need it. They're a storied adventurer of their own right.#$b#They mentioned they've been doing this for years, with a number of close encounters.#$b#I can't help but worry when you lot do your thing. I know it's necessary, but... I do fret about it often.",
  "CT.Gunther.MateoPain": "Mateo, in this hospital... first Marlon's eye, and now - oh, dear.",
  "CT.Gunther.MateoRecovery": "Mateo has returned! Thank goodness. They're looking a little worse for wear, though. You should check on them.",
  "CT.Gunther.CGuildConstruction": "I'm working on getting the license paperwork ready for Mateo and Marlon's little project. I understand Mateo's desire to skew towards academics over swordplay after what happened.",
  "CT.Gunther.CGuildComplete": "Mateo has grown so much since I've known them. Honestly, I almost wish... they'd fallen under my care all those years ago, instead of ending up with Wyatt.#$b#I feel as though I could've spared them some of the emotional adversity. I...#$b#I wouldn't have let them build all the self-resentment that they did.#$b#Seeing the guild there on the beach felt like... well, quite the fairy-tale ending, didn't it? I was very excited to discuss Mateo's pursuits...#$b#...And then I saw all of the tabletop bits and pieces on the table, and the documentation on the bookshelves...",
  "CT.Gunther.MateoDate": "I can't say I'm surprised to see you and Mateo together. Some stories have predictable outcomes, do they not?",
  "CT.Gunther.MateoIntegrity": "Mateo borrowed several books for 'a friend' the other day. Who was it, if not you?... I suppose it doesn't matter, they get returned on time.",
  "CT.Gunther.MateoDeclaration": "Mateo's pitch for a new research paper was quite impressive. I'm looking forward to their academic pursuits.",

  "CT.Pierre.MateoConfrontation": "Mateo's stopped in here a few times. It's been good to catch up; I haven't seen them around since they were a kid.$1",
  "CT.Pierre.MateoPain": "Mateo stumbled by the other day and I haven't seen them since...$2",
  "CT.Pierre.MateoRecovery": "Sounds like Mateo is back from Zuzu, looking a little worse for wear.#$b#I tried to tell Abigail this is why the mines are so dangerous, but she wasn't having any of it.$2",

  // CAROLINE
  "CT.Caroline.MateoLibrary": "I saw Mateo pass by, but they didn't say anything. They used to be so sociable.$2",
  "CT.Caroline.MateoConfrontation": "I had to tell Mateo not to bring their sword inside. We have enough trouble keeping Abigail out of the mines...$2",

  // GUS
  "CT.Gus.MateoLibrary": "Was that Mateo outside the other night? It's been years since they've been around. I'm surprised they didn't stop in. $2",
  "CT.Gus.MateoConfrontation": "Mateo's hardly changed a bit. That kid can put down more pumpkin than anyone else I've ever met.$1",
  "CT.Gus.MateoAcceptance": "Mateo came by for lunch the other day, and you bet I sent them off with the biggest pumpkin pie I could throw together. $1",
  "CT.Gus.MateoPain": "I'm making Mateo a spread of pumpkin desserts for when they get out of the hospital.$0#$b#That'll cheer them right up!",
  "CT.Gus.MateoRecovery": "Mateo's back! I knew they'd be alright. Time to go drop off all the snacks I made while they were gone.$1",

  // HALEY
  "CT.Haley.MateoLibrary": "Someone walked past me with a sword covered in slime! They smelled absolutely disgusting. $3",
  "CT.Haley.MateoConfrontation": "Mateo doesn't seem so bad once you get to know them.#$b#I can relate.$2",

  // HARVEY
  "CT.Harvey.MateoLibrary": "Mateo walked by the other day, sword in hand. It's been quite some time.",
  "CT.Harvey.MateoAdmission": "I caught Mateo looking like they'd taken quite a beating. I tried to patch them up, but they ... very politely refused and went on their way. $2",
  "CT.Harvey.MateoConfrontation": "Mateo was in my office the other day. They bought tonics and remedies before heading up into the mountains.#$b#It was nice to have someone else to talk to about the difficulties of a PhD program, though I'm surprised they don't call themselves Dr. Luis! They earned it!$1#$b# They're warming up to people again. It's a notable improvement to the state of their mental health.$1",
  "CT.Harvey.MateoPain": "I understand you might be a bit worried, @.$2#$b#But Mateo's safely at the hospital getting better treatment than I could give them here in the clinic. They'll be okay - just give them some time.$0",
  "CT.Harvey.MateoRecovery": "I checked up on Mateo as soon as they got back to town. They've recovered brilliantly, considering how bad the damage was.$1#$b#I'm no... adventurer, but I feel like that sort of encounter would've ended much more poorly for an ordinary person.$2",

  // ROBIN
  "CT.Robin.MateoAdmission": "Mateo stopped by the other day on their way to the mines! It was so nice to see them. $1",
  "CT.Robin.MateoAcceptance": "Is Mateo going to live in that tent on the beach forever? I should help them...$2",
  "CT.Robin.CGuildConstruction": "Thanks for helping with the guild, @!$1 It's a big project, but I'm excited for it.",
  "CT.Robin.CGuildComplete": "I'm very proud of how the guild looks. Some of my best work! I'm not sure what Mateo wanted the trapdoor on the roof for, though.$1",

  // WILLY
  "CT.Willy.MateoAdmission": "Ol' Mateo was on the pier the other day. I haven't seen that kid in years. They look like they've come around just fine. $1",
  "CT.Willy.MateoConfrontation": "Lil' ol Matty got so big since I last saw 'em. They may have learned their way around a sword, but they couldn't handle a fishing rod to save their lives. $1",

  // LEWIS
  "CT.Lewis.MateoLibrary": "Mateo's living in East Scarp, I hear. Why didn't they let me know they were coming home?... $2",
  "CT.Lewis.MateoConfrontation": "Mateo was all smiles the other day. They cut through the square instead of crossing the bridge and heading north, and they waved at Marnie and I. $1",
  "CT.Lewis.MateoPain": "Mateo's at the hospital... I hope this discourages people from going too far into the mines.#$b#...I'm worried about them.$2",
  "CT.Lewis.MateoRecovery": "Sounds like Mateo is right as rain and ready to cause trouble like they always have!$1",
  "CT.Lewis.CGuildConstruction": "Robin's building a place for Mateo? About time!$1",
  "CT.Lewis.CGuildComplete": "Wait a second, they built another guild branch? I didn't authorize this.$3#$b#I suppose it makes sense to have a branch of the guild a little closer to home. Besides, there's that old mine that collapsed... and we don't know what's in there.$2",

  // MARNIE
  "CT.Marnie.MateoConfrontation": "I saw Mateo outside yesterday, petting cows through the fence like when they were a kid. I guess they haven't changed very much! $1",
  "CT.Marnie.MateoPain": "Oh, Mateo. I've known them since they were a nugget; hearing they got hurt like that is devastating. I hope they're back soon.$2",
  "CT.Marnie.MateoRecovery": "I caught Mateo having picked the barn door lock to come and visit the livestock, so it seems they've made a full recovery!$1",

  "Core.Cirrus.Spring.8": "I bet fresh milk, eggs and the like make for great ingredients. If you bring stuff over, I'd be happy to make you a big fat breakfast.$1",
  "Core.Cirrus.Spring.9": "The one thing I don't like about the Spring and Summertime are the frequency of rain and storms. I'll take snow over thunder and rain any day.$20#$b#Being inside isn't the worst, but I'd much rather be spending the nicer half of the year out.$18",
  "Core.Cirrus.Spring.10": "My favorite Spring crop is probably strawberries, because you can cut the tops, gut them, fill them with cheesecake, and dip them in chocolate for a great treat and having them fresh is the best!$1",

  // SUMMER
  "Core.Cirrus.Summer.1": "Are you a beach-goer, @? We should go sometime, we could collect some shells, clean them, paint them - make little keepsakes!$1#$b#Maybe we can do some stuff with resin - I've never worked with resin before, but hey, it's never too late to start!$17",
  "Core.Cirrus.Summer.2": "Nothing beats laying out on a towel and catching some sun. The warmth, the vibes, the beachy tunes. It's all perfect.$14#$b#Add in desserts made with seasonal fruit and a lump of homemade ice cream and it makes for a perfect day.$1",
  "Core.Cirrus.Summer.3": "My favorite icecream is a chocolate base, with marshmallow and caramel swirl, and chunks of chocolate. Bonus points if they're in fun shapes. What's yours, @?$1",
  "Core.Cirrus.Summer.4": "I bet there's a lot of really solid fish you can catch this time of year. Most importantly, you can cook delicious meals with those fresh-caught fish!$1#$b#Maybe avoid cooking with Pufferfish, though, I think that's a recipe for disaster.$17",
  "Core.Cirrus.Summer.8": "You ever get that summertime sadness, @?$16#$b#Me neither. It's so hard to be down when your surroundings are flourishing and everyone seems so happy.$1",
  "Core.Cirrus.Summer.5": "I'm pretty proud of my wardrobe, but in particular, I go through a lot of swimsuits. There are just so many cute options these days.$25",
  "Core.Cirrus.Summer.6": "Have you seen those rainbow shells that wash up on the beach? They catch the light so nice, and they've got a nice weight to them.$1#$b#Those mermaid pendants married folks wear look a lot like them, don't they? Maybe that's what they're made of.$17",
  "Core.Cirrus.Summer.7": "Oooh, that's right! Starfruit is in season. You can make really tasty treats with those - have you ever dipped one in chocolate and frozen it? Delicious!$1",
  "Core.Cirrus.Summer.9": "You and I should visit ZuZu sometime, @. There's nothing like Summer in the city. It'll hit different now that you're not caught in the rat race.$14",
  "Core.Cirrus.Summer.10": "Air conditioning takes so much to run, I just try and spend as much time outside as possible. Is it sweaty? Yeah, but it keeps me active.$17",

  // FALL
  "Core.Cirrus.Fall.1": "'Tis the season to make every comfort food under the sun. Here's a pumpkin treat for your health, @!$1#$b#Definitely your health, not me foisting my excess on whoever passes. Look, I portion with my heart.$17[608 236] ",

  "Core.Cirrus.Fall.4": "It's pumpkin spice season! But not only that, it's mulled cider season, it's pie season, it's still s'mores season if you squint, it's-$1#$b#%This goes on for a while.",
  "Core.Cirrus.Fall.5": "Cities have parks - I mean, ZuZu's got a big one in it's center - but it's not the same as all the foliage just being... everywhere.$1#$b#Yeah, yeah. Call me a leaf-peeper all you want, but it's because you're used to it. Let this city girl have nice things.$17",
  "Core.Cirrus.Fall.6": "One of the things I've noticed about city folk is that the weather doesn't matter - the coffee is always iced.$16#$b#I don't mind either way, coffee is coffee, it doesn't do much for me in the energy department.$1",
  "Core.Cirrus.Fall.7": "Okay, okay, but I've got an idea - so in ZuZu there were pop up Spirit's Eve stores around this time of year.$15#$b#What if you open one up in Spring? Hit the niche market of early costume preppers.$14",
  "Core.Cirrus.Fall.8": "I'm looking forward to Spirit's Eve, but I think the Fall Festival will be just as fun. Am I biased? Maybe.$1#$b#Look, I'm not sure there's a single person in the known universe who can actually turn down a deep-fried cookie.$17",
  "Core.Cirrus.Fall.9": "I do have a big appreciation for horror movie scores, especially the classic ones. Sometimes, minimal and chilling works a lot better than heavy orchestration.$14#$b#I think it's more memorable, too.$17",
  "Core.Cirrus.Fall.10": "@ It's your lucky day! Once again, I completely overcooked. I was going with the theme of the season, and well... here you go![235]",

  // WINTER
  "Core.Cirrus.Winter.1": "It's so cold out! I can't believe how quickly everything turned to snow - and it's STAYING snow!$15#$b#In the city, these light dustings turned to slush real quick, so snow was the enemy.$14",
  "Core.Cirrus.Winter.2": "I knowwww, I know. City girl impressed by country winters. It's really trite. Just let me have this. Maybe the magic will wear off, maybe it won't.$17#$b#I know this is the plot of some of the cheesiest movies out there.$16",
  "Core.Cirrus.Winter.3": "Coffee's good for warming me up. Doesn't give me jitters or energy or anything particularly helpful like that - I've got a whole thermos here though, want some?$17#$b#I used a bunch of instant and let it steep for a while. Tastes great![253]$1",
  "Core.Cirrus.Winter.4": "Maybe it's weird, maybe it's not. But I don't like heavy coats. I'd rather layer a whole bunch then wear like, one stupid puffy jacket.$20#$b#Makes me feel like I'm gonna fall over and get stuck in the snow.$16",
  "Core.Cirrus.Winter.5": "Soup, soup, soup, soup. Soup for me, and soup for...$8#$b#...Youp.$17[218]#$b#Listen, @, none of my songs rhyme. None of them.$20",
  "Core.Cirrus.Winter.6": "Is Winter like being on a very long vacation for you, or do you keep busy in other ways? Must be like being between tours. Take the time to relax, recoup, and plan for next year.$0#$b#Oh... wait, that's just what bears do.$16",
  "Core.Cirrus.Winter.7": "Cooking when it's cold out is the best feeling. Home is where the heart is, food is also where the heart is, at home - wait.$20#$b#Wait, that metaphor was terrible. All my hobbies, writing jokes and emotionally compelling one-liners is not one of them.$17",
  "Core.Cirrus.Winter.8": "It really does get chilly here, doesn't it? Well, that's alright. But there's plenty to look forward to; festivals, birthdays, quiet moments, springtime...$17",
  "Core.Cirrus.Winter.9": "I was feeling pretty inspired by the scenery and started working on a new song. Just a piano composition, nothing crazy. But The Valley in the wintertime really sets a mood.$17",
  "Core.Cirrus.Winter.10": "Hey, @! So, I wanted to try something different, something a little festive - I've never really tried doing jams or preserves or anything like that. But wanted to give cranberry sauce a try. Here you go![238]$1",

  // 10H LION'S MANE
  "Core.Cirrus.LionsMane.1": "Hey, @! Don't worry about the menu at the Lion's Mane, okay? If you've got a craving, let me handle it. It's the least I can do after you've been such a good friend.$17",
  "Core.Cirrus.LionsMane.2": "I've got a system to keep everything at the Lion's Mane clean. I'd rather get anxious from not doing a routine, than not have one at all.$20#$b#Whatever works, works. Such a big space is hard to keep tidy, but I'm working really hard to keep everything up and running.$1",
  "Core.Cirrus.LionsMane.3": "You're more than welcome to stop by whenever, @. I'll cook, you can bring that lyre of yours, and we'll jam out.$1#$b#It's really nice having a living space that I can actually host in. I've never lived in a building that large before.$17",
  "Core.Cirrus.LionsMane.4": "Hungry, @? Stop by the Lion's Mane, I'll make sure you're taken care of. You helped restore the place, after all. I'll return the favor with a full belly!$1",
  "Core.Cirrus.LionsMane.5": "I've never had a bedroom before, @. My mother and I lived in a mobile home, and then I was living out of the van to save money.$16#$b#The Lion's Mane means the world to me. Thanks for helping make it happen, @. This town wouldn't be the same without you.$17",
  "Core.Cirrus.LionsMane.6": "It's wild to actually have customers! I'm not really relying on the Lion's Mane's finances for like, anything more than maintaining the building, but...$1#$b#It sure is nice to have a bit of extra pocket money once in a while, doing something that's way less stressful than touring.$1",
  "Core.Cirrus.LionsMane.7": "One of my favorite things about the restoration was being able to decorate the space myself without any input or commentary from anyone else.$17#$b#It was a really big deal, kind of like a step forward. And things can only get better and better from here!$1",
  "Core.Cirrus.LionsMane.8": "The Meadowlark? Oh, he lived here while the building was still dilapidated. I didn't have the heart to kick him out when I remodeled.$17",
  "Core.Cirrus.LionsMane.9": "It feels like I stopped doing music professionally, and then suddenly, and without warning, I got hit with a rush of musical inspiration.$22#$b#It's great. I play so much more NOW than I did prior! I thought I'd lose interest, but I think I just needed a break.$1",
  "Core.Cirrus.LionsMane.10": "After the Lion's Mane was built, I thought I'd step back from music. But it's been quite the opposite; I've been playing and writing more than I have in years.$4#$b#Thank you, @. Maybe one day I'll write a song for you, and for everything you've done. I know you're carrying the entire Valley on your back.$6",

  "Core.Cirrus.Dating.3": "I think about our relationship often, and there's so much of it that feels right out of one of those sappy holiday movies. Like, okay, hear me out.$25#$b#City girl is temporarily in the country, is convinced to stay by kindly farmer and {{LPPN1}} friends, opens a shop, falls in love, and embraces true happiness and passion or whatever.$24#$b#C'mon, @. Don't tell me you haven't seen that one before.$24",
  "Core.Cirrus.Dating.4": "Wow, Rockstar. You sure are looking like you put your hours in today. Have you always been so... tightly muscled?$23#$b#If I asked really nicely, could you carry me? How about if I asked not-so-nicely?$25",
  "Core.Cirrus.Dating.5": "I wanted to cook for you, but I think I might have gone a little overboard. So first I figured I'd make sure you had a hearty lunch...$23[240]#$b#Couldn't forget the healthy side salad, of course.[196]$25#$b#But then I was like, no wait, @ should also have a snack, so I whipped these up really quick-[220]$23#$b#And then, finally, I realized you'd probably want to wash all that down. Anyway, hope you have a very fulfilling day, @! Love you![167]$24",
  "Core.Cirrus.Dating.6": "How could I NOT just look at you and immediately think, 'talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show-stopping'?$24#$b#That's right! I can't. It's impossible. Can't do it. Nope.$25",
  "Core.Cirrus.Dating.7": "I think about my mom often, still. She hasn't tried to contact me in a while, which is a good thing! I guess it goes to show that like...$23#$b#The blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb, but cheese dip is thicker than both! Thanks for being my cheese dip.$17#$b#That sounded cuter in my head...$20",
  "Core.Cirrus.Dating.8": "I'm going birdwatching with Eloise and Biróg sometime soon! Would you want to join us, Rockstar? It involves being really quiet, a nice change of pace from other more chaotic hobbies.$1#$b#I guess it's one of two things that can shut me up.$25",
  "Core.Cirrus.Dating.9": "Being with you is incredible, @. You're kind, sweet, encouraging, patient...$23#$b#Yeah, patient is a big one. I know talking to me about my Interest of the Week can be a bit like drinking from a firehose. But thanks for listening.$25",
  "Core.Cirrus.Dating.10": "You know, @, I'd love for you to sing for me. If you're interested, anyway. No reason to be nervous about it. You are a bard in your own right, after all.$23#$b#I could also think of a few more creative ways to get you to sing, if you pick up what I'm putting down.$25",
  "Core.Cirrus.Dating.11": "So I was thinking of getting into painting shoes.$16#$b#If I made you a pair, what colors would you like? Would you wear them or would that be embarrassing? Do you have a pair I could mess with-?$17",
  "Core.Cirrus.Dating.12": "If you think of ways I can help you with %farm, don't be afraid to ask. The Lion's Mane keeps me pretty busy, but I'll make time for you.$1#$b#Even if you just need some sprinklers fixed up or something, just let me know.$4 ",

  "Core.Cirrus.Dating.14": "Okay, so hypothetically. If I was outside your window at night, jamming on the keytar and screaming a love song at the top of my lungs, would you be into that?$4#$b#Asking for a friend. It's me, I'm the friend. I want to know for entirely good-intentioned reasons.$25",

  "Core.Cirrus.Dating.16": "@, are there any niche hobbies you'd be interested in trying? I'd try it with you, if you'd like. I think it'd be fun to get into something new together.$4#$b#Maybe we can build and paint models, or learn a new tabletop game together. Oh, what about collecting coins-?$23",

I want to commit all those details to memory.$23",

  "Core.Roslin.Generic.LateHeart.12": "Some perceive sorcery as an intricate practice. It's not, because I don't think emotions are intricate. I think they're raw, honest.$11#$b#That is the drive behind that sort of magic. Intent. And intent is fueled by feelings, by morals.$10",
  "Core.Roslin.Generic.LateHeart.13": "I collect spell components in my spare time. Anything can be used, really. Bird feathers. Weird herbs. Rocks. Gems. If it meant anything to something, you can use it.$11",

  "Core.Roslin.Generic.LateHeart.20": "Years and years ago, the White Lodge ran closely alongside the Circle of Thorns.$13#$b#I do believe they started to lose their way after The Circle disbanded; druids seem more morally upstanding than sorcerers, in my experience.$9",
  "Core.Roslin.Generic.LateHeart.21": "Dandelion's time with her order? You'd have to ask her, there's no reason for me to speak on her behalf.$11#$b#I will say, I'm biased, but I am in favor of her reasons for breaking her oath.$18",
  "Core.Roslin.Generic.LateHeart.22": "I am primarily inclined to fire magic, although my connection to Solomon bolsters my skills pertaining to The Void.$11#$b#What element speaks to you, @? It's okay to have a favorite. I don't think the building blocks have opinions on that sort of thing.$10",
  "Core.Roslin.Generic.LateHeart.23": "Cirrus sure knows how to make a damn fine cup of coffee.$11#$b#And, although she claims not to be a baker, she makes a cherry pie to die for.$7",
  "Core.Roslin.Generic.LateHeart.24": "I like my coffee black. Dandelion likes a tiny little drop of coffee in a mug of milk, basically.$17#$b#But goodness forbid you suggest putting a bit of sugar or milk in tea. That's smiting territory.$16",
  "Core.Roslin.Generic.LateHeart.25": "Dandelion and I have made an effort not to take up much of Cirrus' kitchen space, especially considering we order most of our meals from her anyway.$11#$b#That has not stopped Dandelion from having an entire cabinet of various teas.$15",
  "Core.Roslin.Generic.LateHeart.26": "Oh, most of the books you see around the Lion's Mane belong to me.$15#$b#Dandelion hides hers, because they're all... spicy, dark-fantasy type things.$19",
  "Core.Roslin.Generic.LateHeart.27": "My idea of a perfect night spent independently involves studying magic, the mood set by candles and background music...$17#$b#Dandelion is much the same, but the rate at which she consumes fantasy fiction is astounding.$11",
  "Core.Roslin.Generic.LateHeart.28": "I don't have many hobbies, although I'm trying to branch out my interests now that I'm settled in.$11#$b#Dandelion has been having quite a lot of fun making potions for the shop. It's something she's always wanted to do, but never had the means.$10",
  "Core.Roslin.Generic.LateHeart.29": "I introduced Dandelion to alchemy, although I do believe it's simply an extension of her obsession with tea.$6#$b#What is brewing, if not mundane alchemy anyway?$8",

  "Core.Roslin.Generic.LateHeart.31": "The birds sang as Dandelion and I watched the sunrise together. It was a beautiful morning, one I'll appreciate for a very long time.$18",
  "Core.Roslin.Generic.LateHeart.32": "Everything is made up of essence. Fire, earth, air, water - they are the foundation on which everything else stands on.$15#$b#Solar, void and druidic are a little more situational, but serve as building blocks just the same.$16",
  "Core.Roslin.Generic.LateHeart.33": "I feel as though I can see in color again. I can appreciate the change in season, the details of my surroundings, the activity of people passing by...$10",
  "Core.Roslin.Generic.LateHeart.34": "Dandelion made mashed potatoes with dinner the other night. It was at that point, I realized, that not EVERYTHING tastes like them anymore.$18",
  "Core.Roslin.Generic.LateHeart.35": "Cirrus is a large part of the reason I think I was able to make it through the situation with Dandelion.$1#$b#Without her limitless positivity, I feel as though I would've fallen into despair.$6",
  "Core.Roslin.Generic.LateHeart.36": "I have a good time indulging in nostalgia with Biróg.$1#$b#While I agree that disbanding the Circle of Thorns was for the best, I do miss the camaraderie that our organizations had.$3",
  "Core.Roslin.Generic.LateHeart.37": "Mateo is a good person, and Dandelion was right to place her trust in them. I believed Marlon's successor would be more inclined to following in his footsteps.$9#$b#But they didn't. And I'm thankful for it.$1",
  "Core.Roslin.Generic.LateHeart.38": "One of the things I'm now most grateful for is that I no longer have to try and map out my future without Dandelion.$3",
  "Core.Roslin.Generic.LateHeart.39": "It turned out Dandelion's fate wasn't written in the stars, after all. There's no longer a need to threaten to rip them from the sky; I can just appreciate the view.$3",
  "Core.Roslin.Generic.LateHeart.40": "I'm glad my protection spell worked, although I could've been a bit more specific. Going forward, I probably should not be turning people into inanimate objects.$10",
  "Core.Roslin.Generic.LateHeart.41": "Neither me nor Dandelion know the circumstances behind the loss of her limbs, as if it was wiped from our memories.$13#$b#I think she finds comfort in making up stories about it.$10",
  "Core.Roslin.Generic.LateHeart.42": "Dandelion has two hands and both of them fit in mine perfectly. One is just a little colder than the other, that's all.$12",
  "Core.Roslin.Generic.LateHeart.43": "Dandelion used to use a sword, but she's been lacking in finesse ever since her arm was taken. Now she just bludgeons things with her shield.$6",
  "Core.Roslin.Generic.LateHeart.44": "I wonder how Dandelion comes up with all the wild scenarios she tells people when they ask about her limbs.$6#$b#I always thought they'd figure it was par for the course, since she's an adventurer. But it does raise eyebrows.$13",
  "Core.Roslin.Generic.LateHeart.45": "I asked Dandelion for a hand the other day and she removed her mechanical limb at the elbow and threw it to me.$16",

  // SPRING
  "Core.Roslin.Spring.1": "Everyone loves the turn of the new year and neglects to mention the allergies.$5",

  "Core.Roslin.Spring.3": "Here's hoping you're not too overworked this time of year. I imagine you're probably making up for winter.$3",

  // SUMMER
  "Core.Roslin.Summer.1": "Air conditioners hate this ONE trick - magically changing your body temperature depending on the weather. Handy trick for staying comfortable.$7",
  "Core.Roslin.Summer.2": "I'm not much of a beach person, but whatever. I'll go if Dandelion wants to go. She looks cute in her swimsuit, anyway.$8",
  "Core.Roslin.Summer.3": "I love how everyone complains about the heat, but then they decide to have a festival involving a giant pot of soup.$7",

  // FALL
  "Core.Roslin.Fall.1": "Yes, yes. Roasted seeds, pretty leaves, good weather. Whatever. I'm sure everyone's being excited in your general direction about the time of year.$11",
  "Core.Roslin.Fall.2": "Dandelion insists this is the coziest time of year, perfect for tea. But she drinks tea at least twice a day, no matter what the season...$6",
  "Core.Roslin.Fall.3": "I will admit, seeing Mateo and crew all playing their instruments on an early morning in the mountains was fairly endearing.$3",

  // WINTER
  "Core.Roslin.Winter.1": "Sleeves are for people who can't cheat the system with magic. You should try it, @.$7",
  "Core.Roslin.Winter.2": "I've traveled to places where the snow accumulates almost as high as I stand tall. I hate that.$9",
  "Core.Roslin.Winter.3": "I appreciate Dandelion's tea obsession much more in the Winter than I do in the Summer, I must admit.$10",

  // NAME 
  "Core.Solomon.Name": "Solomon",

  // INTRODUCTION
  "Core.Solomon.Introduction": "How nice it is, to have a stationary place to call my own. Yes, it's a cave. But it's MY cave!$1#$b#Very nice of The Bard to allow additional magickal construction to her building.$0",

  // GENERIC
  "Core.Solomon.Generic.1": "Everyone's like, oh no! Void magic! It's bad! 'Waah, I'm afraid of what I don't understand!'$2#$b#Ignorant fools! Being afraid of The Void is like being afraid of your own feelings!$5",
  "Core.Solomon.Generic.2": "If there is something your superiors don't want you to learn, find out WHY and make a priority to learn it immediate!$1",
  "Core.Solomon.Generic.3": "Remember, @. Even the most esteemed sorcerers can be bested by a skilled blacksmith... Oh, the stories I could tell you.$6#$b#Magic-users contain multitudes. Namely, being simultaneously brilliant and stupid.$7",
  "Core.Solomon.Generic.4": "The Void is simply 'What Fills'; it emboldens emotions, positive, negative, and everything in between.$7#$b#To imply that it's negative strictly on that basis is so tired.$10",
  "Core.Solomon.Generic.5": "You know, love and intimacy make for the most powerful Magick. Think about it, @.$4#$b#You saw what The Void did with GRIEF; think of what it could do with LOVE!$1",
  "Core.Solomon.Generic.6": "Magick can be very mundane, but it garners a lot less respect that way. Are sunsets not magick? Are flowers not?$9#$b#Just have a bit of whimsy, will you?$10",
  "Core.Solomon.Generic.7": "Study technique. Adapt it. But do not research anything blindly!$5",
  "Core.Solomon.Generic.8": "I was once part of the Order of the Golden Dawn, a coalition of Shadow Folk who wanted to explore the surface before the Elemental Wars.$9#$b#They were all stupid ninnies who talked big but took no action so I ditched them to explore with Roslin instead.$6",
  "Core.Solomon.Generic.9": "Organizations are stupid. Authority is stupid. Bathtime is stupid.$8",
  "Core.Solomon.Generic.10": "The Druid is very wise. The Rogue is very charming. The Bard...$1#$b#She makes me snaaacks.$4#$b#She's my favorite. Not just for that. She's also the smartest and nicest and whatever.$0",
  "Core.Solomon.Generic.11": "Roslin and I have been companions for a very long time. So long, in fact, I'm almost glad we can spend some time apart.$2#$b#Watch it, I said almost. She's my best friend! The mayhem to my mischief! My study buddy now and forever!$1",
  "Core.Solomon.Generic.12": "Dandelion and Roslin are very good for each other. They tick off all the boxes!$1#$b#One is tall, one is small. One does swords, one does sorcery. One is nice, one isn't!$6",
  "Core.Solomon.Generic.13": "I am confined to Roslin's shadow outdoors in the daylight, but it allows me to see the surface safely without judgment from nervous humans.$0#$b#At least I get to be out and about in The Lion's Mane as much as I want.$6#$b#Though, there might be a reason for concern if The Scarp's more mundane residents were buying armaments and potions on the regular.$3",
  "Core.Solomon.Generic.14": "Dandelion makes the potions for the shop. Pretty sure she sees the ancient alchemical arts as like, making tea but with extra steps.$9",
  "Core.Solomon.Generic.15": "Roslin and Dandelion both tell the story of how they got together differently. But, don't worry, I will happily indulge you with the truth.$1#$b#They were on a quest together, begrudgingly. They stopped overnight at an inn, and paid for a room...$7#$b#But there was only one bed.$6",
  "Core.Solomon.Generic.16": "I do believe that Roslin conspires to infuriate me sometimes. That heathen said I wasn't SCARY. Gaze into my horrifying visage and fear it!$5",
  "Core.Solomon.Generic.17": "Curse Roslin's moral upstanding, which has bled into my being... I would be so much COOLER if I was EVIL.$10#$b#My sheer malevolence and badness would terrifying.$6",
  "Core.Solomon.Generic.18": "Roslin should be taller. It must be due to some deplorable cosmic error that I would be stuck with such a tiny vessel.$10",
  "Core.Solomon.Generic.19": "Sometimes I daydream about being a great, evil, Shadow King. I never will be, though, so I just randomly knock things off shelves for fun.$9",
  "Core.Solomon.Generic.20": "I alphabetized Roslin's books yesterday. I bet she'll be so annoyed about it.$6",
  "Core.Solomon.Generic.21": "If someone tells you not to read a book, read it immediately.$7",
  "Core.Solomon.Generic.22": "I think The Rogue is the only figure in a position of power I trust, because they reject authority in favor of leadership. Woah.$3",
  "Core.Solomon.Generic.23": "Just because I do not like the sun, does not mean I cannot appreciate everything basked in it's light.$0",
  "Core.Solomon.Generic.24": "I understand there's at least one other Shadow Folk living near humans... oh, how things have changed over the years.$4",
  "Core.Solomon.Generic.25": "The Rogue wanted to interview me for an addenda to their dissertation. I am very flattered.$4#$b#But I am very tempted to feed them false, but hilarious, information about Shadow culture.$6",
  "Core.Solomon.Generic.26": "One should strive to act with compassion and empathy toward ALL creatures... within REASON!$5#$b#You can't reason with all monsters, @. Hell, you can't even reason with all Shadow Folk. What's important is that you try.$2",
  "Core.Solomon.Generic.27": "Justice should prevail over laws and institutions! That's why Dandelion broke her Oath, you know.$10#$b#She chose empathy, love and kindness over rigidity, title and esteem.$1",
  "Core.Solomon.Generic.28": "You body is subject to your will alone, @. The pact Roslin and I made was consensual. We stand against the world as equals.$1#$b#You are inviolable. Do not forget.$6",
  "Core.Solomon.Generic.29": "Remember, @! To willfully and unjustly encroach on the freedoms of another is to forgo one's own.$6#$b#That is why Roslin abandoned her order in the first place. She didn't want to be responsible for deciding the fate of others.$2",
  "Core.Solomon.Generic.30": "I conform my beliefs to the most scientific understanding of the world. Magick is real, but it is based in metaphysics.$7#$b#I study that the same way someone would study chemistry in a lab!$1",
  "Core.Solomon.Generic.31": "@, it is expected of you to make mistakes. To err is to be human, after all.$3#$b#What is also expected of you is to do your best to rectify those mistakes and resolve any harm you may have caused.$10",
  "Core.Solomon.Generic.32": "Wisdom, compassion, and justice should always prevail. Anything written in stone will eventually be eroded away by rain.$4",
  "Core.Solomon.Generic.33": "Of course there's darkness in the world, @. After all, the closer you stand to the light, the greater a shadow you cast.$2",
  "Core.Solomon.Generic.34": "To fear the unknown is base. To embrace it, is human.$8",
  "Core.Solomon.Generic.35": "Remember always that love is all you need.$4",
  "Core.Solomon.Generic.36": "Roslin and Dandelion may not remember why the Paladin is something of a 'fullmetal' alchemist, but *I* do! And, no, I'm not telling.$6",
  "Core.Solomon.Generic.37": "Hm? Oh, trust me. Dandelion is better off being down an arm and a leg than the alternative. They might not remember the circumstances, but I do.$1",
  "Core.Solomon.Generic.38": "All magic comes at a cost, @.$11#$b#Just because you don't notice that cost in the moment, doesn't mean it won't come back around expecting interest at another time.$9",
  "Core.Solomon.Generic.39": "Magic is intention, @. You can do anything as long as you've got the willpower to make it so. Bring someone back from the brink, even.$7#$b#Like anything else, though, it comes at a cost...$6",
  "Core.Solomon.Generic.40": "Memories are a funny thing, aren't they? Sometimes you have them, sometimes they magically disappear and leave your brain riddled with gaps.$7#$b#Would be a shame if that happened to you... or your loved one, huh?$6",

  // SPIRIT'S EVE
  "Festivals.Solomon.fall27.1": "Don't be suspicious, don't be suspicious, don't be suspicious...$3#$b#Hello, fellow human, who certainly thinks I am simply wearing a very convincing Shadow Folk costume!$1",
  "Festivals.Solomon.fall27.2": "I am here to eat silly human candies until I yartz into a bush, which is truly representative of this experience.$6",
  "Festivals.Solomon.fall27.3": "Little do these people know that there are much more substantial things to be afraid of in this world than the fare that wander the mines.$8",

  // CONVERSATION TOPICS

  // CH 4
  "CT.Solomon.DandelionReturns": "I'm so glad Dandelion's back! Now maybe Roslin will get some proper rest instead of crying herself to sleep every night!$0",
  "CT.Solomon.DandelionSettling": "It's weird to work like, a job. I guess it's not really a job. I don't really have customers. I kind of just stand there.$10#$b#Well, I stand there and look cute.$6",
  "CT.Solomon.DandelionShieldRepair": "Can't you just hot glue the shield back together? Why not?$2",
  "CT.Solomon.DandelionShieldRestored": "Oooh, Roslin's gonna be piiiiiiiissed.$6",
  "CT.Solomon.FullmetalDandelion": "I wonder how much Dandelion's arm would sell for if I stole it.$7",
  "CT.Solomon.DandelionPendant": "Dandelion and Roslin are gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay-$4",
  "CT.Solomon.SolomonGift": "I hope you cause lots of problems on purpose with your newfound magical abilities!$1",
  "CT.Solomon.IntoTheDeepDark": "It's icky down here.$3",
  "CT.Solomon.DuskspireEncounter": "Did you see when I cast that spell and the Duskwhatever was like AHHHH BESTED AGAIN- yeah, I know, I could've solo'd that thing.$0",

  // CH 5
  "CT.Solomon.DandelionProposes": "Dandy and Rozzie sittin' in a tree, k-i-s-s-i-n-g.$6",
  "CT.Solomon.WyattReturns": "Wait, Mateo and some dude stole a bunch of stuff? No heckin' way. I didn't know Mateo did crime.$3",
  "CT.Solomon.HectorPromotion": "Asking the animals what's wrong is cheating! Falsehood, falsehood!$5",
  "CT.Solomon.CirrusAndMom": "Cirrus is my favorite because she makes the best snacks and objectively that's what makes a good person.$1",
  "CT.Solomon.RosalionWedding": "I guess now Rozzie and Dandy are... turbo gay.$4",
  "CT.Solomon.VioletMoonRennFaire": "I'm going to eat everything at the festival and leave NOTHING for NOBODY.$1",
  "CT.Solomon.SwordAndSorcery": "...How 'bout that.$9#$b#Everyone's... having a great time, but... I guess that doesn't mean they are all the time.$2#$b#Sometimes, moments of fun... can just be, a sorta, lifting of the burden. For just a little moment.$9#$b#But, hey. That's life. Ya'know? You have fun. And then you have not-so-fun. You're happy, and then you're sad.$2#$b#That's the roller coaster that is life. Do you hear me? Do you understand?$8",

  // EPILOGUE 
  "Core.Solomon.Epilogue.1": "There's magic in everything, @. It's not just spells or whatever. It's the world around you. It's your responsibility to embrace that, too.$7",
  "Core.Solomon.Epilogue.2": "Wouldn't it be really messed up if that wasn't the last we saw of the Duskspire? Should go back to the bottom of that dungeon and check...$8",
  "Core.Solomon.Epilogue.3": "How's your magical research going? Have you tried throwing a really big fireball into a really small room yet?$6",
  "Core.Solomon.Epilogue.4": "I just realized... you're an artificer, a druid, a bard, a sorcerer, and a paladin? You're the strongest person in the Valley, hot damn.$3",
  "Core.Solomon.Epilogue.5": "A strange sort of finality hangs over the Scarp, doesn't it? No? Maybe that's just me.$9",
  "Core.Solomon.Epilogue.6": "I wonder what's happened to those miners souls now that - what, nothing. Me? Empathetic? NO.$5",
  "Core.Solomon.Epilogue.7": "Take a hard look at how far you've come, @. Didn't it all start with a letter?$7",
  "Core.Solomon.Epilogue.8": "Do you think about what your life COULD have been, compared to where you are now? Is that healthy?$10",
  "Core.Solomon.Epilogue.9": "Why on earth would you brave the Deep Dark a third time, @? What could possibly be down there?$8",
  "Core.Solomon.Epilogue.10": "Something about Stygium and Iridium just make me - what, @? You're interrupting my train of thought.$11",

  "VioletMoon.Aideen.2": "I rather expected to see this area filled to the brim with brambles and refuse, but I believe it's quite cleaned up. Mayor Lewis must find it a pleasant surprise that his civic duties needn't be applied here.",
  "VioletMoon.Aideen.3": "Such strange and vivid colors... They're almost too bold for my tastes but perhaps... Perhaps they'd catch the attention of some passing viscount?",
  "VioletMoon.Beatrice.1": "You know... where I am from? The real thing used to 'appen. This is a much kinder version.$1",
  "VioletMoon.Beatrice.2": "We could do with more soups. Next year, I will take Cirrus aside and teach her to make a soup so soul-warming, it will bring folks all the way from Gotoro to enjoy.",
  "VioletMoon.Beatrice.3": "Ah... That moon is so pretty. You should enjoy it with someone special... if my 'usband were still with us, we'd be moon-gazing together tonight.$1",
  "VioletMoon.Eloise.1": "Do you think maybe next year they'll have falconry displays? I think I'd like to meet a wildlife rehabilitation falconer and their friends someday!",
  "VioletMoon.Eloise.2": "Hector made me a magic flower crown for just for today! Hmmm? You can't see it? Maybe you're not magical enough!",
  "VioletMoon.Eloise.3": "I hope dad lets me pick out a toy shield... Mateo has one with a painted turtle dove, it's perfect for me!",
  "VioletMoon.Eyvinder.1.true": "There's secret lore hidden for those who dare seek it. Don't let cowardice hold you back.",
  "VioletMoon.Eyvinder.2.true": "No one appears to be interested in dressing up as my folk and for that I'm grateful. I don't think I'd enjoy seeing the ghosts of my forefathers.",
  "VioletMoon.Eyvinder.3.true": "The mead's flowing freely and that's all I could ask for - see that Cirrus lass if you're looking for something less alcoholic.",
  "VioletMoon.Eyvinder.1.false": "A costume? Bah, you've had too much mead!",
  "VioletMoon.Eyvinder.2.false": "The attractions are near to the boat, and I am not one of them.",
  "VioletMoon.Eyvinder.3.false": "My people knew this land long before that boat ever docked here... I am not 'larping'.",
  "VioletMoon.Jacob.1": "I can't say that race horses are my usual patients but I'm happy to report the ones gathered here today are in wonderful, well-cared for condition.",
  "VioletMoon.Jacob.2": "Hopefully Eloise doesn't suddenly take up sword fighting... I don't know if I'm ready for her to go school armed with a wooden sword. She's growing up too fast.",
  "VioletMoon.Jacob.3": "I've done some horseback riding - of course, living out here, who hasn't? But I don't know if I'm horse jockey material.",
  "VioletMoon.ToriLK.1": "I wonder if there are any trick performing slimes here... I've seen rats perform at other ren faires, why not slimes?",
  "VioletMoon.ToriLK.2": "I should've have dressed up for the occasion but I was afraid of looking silly. I guess I should've risked it, I feel like I stand out more in my normal clothes now.",
  "VioletMoon.ToriLK.3": "I made sure to budget for today so I wouldn't get too tempted by anything fancy that I wouldn't never use. Although, there's plenty of food options to try out, so I might end up spending more money than I planned anyway.",
  "VioletMoon.Rosa.1": "I don't think I've ever seen a moon like this... it makes the air feel downright magical. I could reach out and touch it, if I wanted to.",
  "VioletMoon.Rosa.2": "A lot of folks have come up and complimented Juliet on her costume. I still think she should've gone with the pirate garb, but this is still pretty and on theme.#$b#...I meant pretty *on* theme.$4",
  "VioletMoon.Rosa.3": "No one offered up funnel cake this year - I've already lodged a 'complaint' with Cirrus and Gus for next year. I think I'll make some of my own.",
  "VioletMoon.Juliet.1": "I'm going to pluck that big violet moon out of the sky and give it to someone special! Who? Well, that's a secret!",
  "VioletMoon.Juliet.2": "Gremlin doesn't like the horses. Which, I totally get - if I were confronted by something that kind of resembled a human but was ten times my size, I'd be skittish too!",
  "VioletMoon.Juliet.3": "Lewis already suggested I can be part of the clean up crew, but Mateo came in clutch and exempted me from being volun-told.",
  "VioletMoon.Jessie.1": "Linus and I have seen all sorts of distant friends today. *Very* distant friends, at that. It's nice to see those friends feeling free to be part of the celebration.",
  "VioletMoon.Jessie.2": "There's plenty of sights to see and things to do, but remember to focus on the experience and not to fret over trying to immortalize it with material means.",
  "VioletMoon.Jessie.3": "I enjoyed the boat ride over but somehow the view from land is even more stunning than the one while on the water. I hope I get to see it again soon.",
  "VioletMoon.Jasper.1": "In my opinion this is quite possibly one of the most historically accurate Smoluanu outfits I've ever seen. I wish the shopkeep would let me speak with them after the festival.",
  "VioletMoon.Jasper.2": "There's an interesting selection of wares available; I can't say I'm in need of bombs very often but I enjoy browsing to see what's available at least.",
  "VioletMoon.Jasper.3": "At festival like this, there's always a bit of whimsy tied to the mundane - a fantastical veneer over history that makes it perhaps more exciting, if not quite accurate.",
  "DN.SnS.Festival.Name": "Violet Moon Renaissance Faire",
  "DN.SnS.Festival.Speak.Abigail": "As soon as Mom and Dad aren't looking, I'm signing up for horseback riding race.#$b#I look SO GOOD in armor! Maybe I can even demonstrate some sword techniques... Oh, maybe I could duel somebody!$1#$b#What say you, @?",
  "DN.SnS.Festival.Speak.Robin": "Do you think there's any business in arrow fletching? It's very tempting, don't you agree, my handsome knight Demetrius?$1",
  "DN.SnS.Festival.Speak.Demetrius": "I'd be more the castle historian, I think, than a knight - my lovely Lady Robin. And whatever you set your mind to can turn into business, you're brilliant honey!$1",
  "DN.SnS.Festival.Speak.Maru": "The Harvest Moon is usually the brightest full moon at the start of fall.#$b#The farmers of yesteryear could harvest crops deep into the night thanks to how bright the moon was!$3#$b#...They're not typically violet, unfortunately. Maybe next year~$1",
  "DN.SnS.Festival.Speak.Sebastian": "This is EXACTLY like Solarian Chronicles! I'd be in costume if I'd realized I could have gotten away with it... maybe next year I'll order one from Emily.",
  "DN.SnS.Festival.Speak.Pierre": "Mmm, I should tailor my wares for this occasion - maybe offer up some of Pierre's General Goods' finest pumpkins and apples! They'll sell like hotcakes.$1",
  "DN.SnS.Festival.Speak.Caroline": "Oh, I just can't locate Abby anywhere... And I just know she's going to go up to one of those knights on horseback and ask for a turn!$2#$b#I think she'd make a fine handkerchief waving fan instead, don't you? And it's so much safer...",
  "DN.SnS.Festival.Speak.Linus": "The food booths are all kindly offering free samples. Generosity has been a timeless tradition through the ages, after all.",
  "DN.SnS.Festival.Speak.Alex": "There should be something for me to really show my physical prowess off at. Horseback racing is cool, but the horse is the strong one in that, right? Not the rider.",
  "DN.SnS.Festival.Speak.George": "Bah. Back in my day, we raced on foot, uphill the whole darn track, and we liked it!",
  "DN.SnS.Festival.Speak.Evelyn": "The amount of people who've called me 'Lady Evelyn' today has been so lovely... What fun it is to be nobility for a day!$1",
  "DN.SnS.Festival.Speak.Lewis": "This sort of event isn't my speed... for instance, where's the granges for me to judge? Where's the livestock for all of us to pet?",
  "DN.SnS.Festival.Speak.Clint": "Historically, my profession is one of the more valuable types... I could easily serve a king or an army, instead of forging the basic necessities of a small town.",
  "DN.SnS.Festival.Speak.Emily": "It's such an inspiring environment! I have so many ideas I want to bring to life now, outfits, maybe get Gus to do a 'meals of history' themed night - this is so fun!",
  "DN.SnS.Festival.Speak.Penny": "Hmm... I'm having a lot of fun! I think some parts of this are a bit more exaggerated than what was true to life, but that's what days like today are for, right? Cutting loose and having fun...#$b#And maybe someone will walk with me up to the peak for some romantic moon-gazing...$4",
  "DN.SnS.Festival.Speak.Pam": "Now this is the kind of feast I can get behind! I've been havin' so much fun kiddo, I haven't even had a chance to sample the mead!$1",
  "DN.SnS.Festival.Speak.Haley": "The fashions of history are best left TO history, don't you think? Although... a cute knight in shining armor IS good no matter what year it is.$4",
  "DN.SnS.Festival.Speak.Jodi": "Well, hopefully Vincent will forget all about the wooden swords we saw... Oh, I *do* hope he'll forget them soon...$2",
  "DN.SnS.Festival.Speak.Kent": "The mead's flowing, the kids are having fun... the night is young and beautiful, and so's my wife Jodi. We needed this.",
  "DN.SnS.Festival.Speak.Sam": "I kind of wanna play the lute. I mean, how hard can it be to play the lute if I already rock on the guitar? What's that song about the Scar Berry Fair again?",
  "DN.SnS.Festival.Speak.Leah": "I almost wished I had a camera because I don't think I'll get all the scenery sketch in time to paint later. Plus Elliott said the food at Cirrus's cart is to die for, and I don't want to miss out!$1",
  "DN.SnS.Festival.Speak.Shane": "If I hear one more dork say 'milady' I'm tossing 'em in the river. It's my responsibility as Jas's godfather to keep those kinds of dweebs away from her.",
  "DN.SnS.Festival.Speak.Marnie": "Oh, Marlon called me 'milady', I can't stop giggling!$2#$b#It's rather romantic under that moon, isn't?",
  "DN.SnS.Festival.Speak.Elliott": "Cirrus sure can cook a feast! I feel like a minor lord, dallying about while she offers up another frosty ginger beer. I think I should get a hat. I'd be dashing, wouldn't I?$1",
  "DN.SnS.Festival.Speak.Gus": "I've offered my hand where I can to help out, but they've got things under control. It sure is nice to take a break from cooking and enjoy things. Why, I'm practically being treated like a King with this break from the kitchens!$1",
  "DN.SnS.Festival.Speak.Wizard": "Ahh yes, this takes me back to the good ol' days. Never you mind how long ago THAT was, mortal.",
  "DN.SnS.Festival.Speak.Harvey": "And here I am without my stock of leeches...#$b#Just a bit of medieval medical humor for you, @. Remember not to startle the horses, they can hurt.",
  "DN.SnS.Festival.Speak.Jas": "I want to be a princess! Or a dragon...#$b#Or a dragon princess!$1",
  "DN.SnS.Festival.Speak.Vincent": "I can't wait til I'm big enough to swing a sword around... Mom says that won't be for another fifty years though.#$b#I thought once I growed up I could do whatever I wanted?$3",
  "DN.SnS.Festival.Speak.Willy": "The waters are so clean and clear out here I reckon I could catch a fish with my bare hands, heh!$3",
  "DN.SnS.Festival.Speak.Leo": "I don't... I don't like the silly talk. The food is good, and the night sky feels like home.",
  "DN.SnS.Festival.Speak.Dwarf": "What an interesting past time you folks have cooked up... Can't just leave history in the dust?",
  "DN.SnS.Festival.Speak.Sandy": "Worth the trip to come out this far. Doesn't Emily look pretty in the moonlight? I'm glad she invited me.$1",


  "DN.SnS.Festival.Dialogue.Lewis1": "Boy, that Faire sure can Renaissance.",
  "DN.SnS.Festival.Dialogue.Lewis2": "Well said, me.",
  "DN.SnS.Festival.End1": "They weren't kiddin', that Faire sure did Renaissance.",

  "DN.SnS.Festival.Question": "Should we Violet on that Moon til we Renaissance Faire?",
  "DN.SnS.Festival.YesAnswer": "Yes.",
  "DN.SnS.Festival.NoAnswer": "No.",

  // MEEP 
  "MEEP.BookOutside.1": "Oh, hello dearest @! How are you doing on this fine day? I hope your tasklist is short and your belly is full of delicious snacks.$1",
  "MEEP.BookOutside.2": "@! What a pleasure to see you. Isn't it beautiful out today? Enjoy the sunshine while we have it! You never know when the rainclouds will come by.$0",
  "MEEP.BookOutside.3": "Goodness, gracious! @, you must be terribly strong to hike all the way up here so often. Or, perhaps, do you warp about with magic?$1",
  "MEEP.BookOutside.4": "You are always the most lovely thing I see when I wander about outside, @. It's quite a treat.$0",
  "MEEP.BookOutside.5": "Oh, yay! It's my favorite visitor! How are you doing, @? Nothing short of excellent, I hope. Have a lovely day, dear. Stay safe.$1",

  "MEEP.BookInside.1": "You can't put your finger on it, but something about Book seems comforting and sincere. Looking at her brings you as much joy as your visit brings her.$0",
  "MEEP.BookInside.2": "Book seems very excitable today! She's flying busily around the room. Perhaps some magic is in progress.$1",
  "MEEP.BookInside.3": "Seems like Book is cross with a certain Druid. Best leave her to her devices, lest she take out some magical aggression on you!$3",
  "MEEP.BookInside.4": "Book is incredibly happy to see you! She flies happily around you in circles for a moment before going back to her tasks.$1",
  "MEEP.BookInside.5": "The magical grimoire appreciates your company, and floats behind you for a moment as you navigate the tower.$0",

  "MEEP.EmeritusOutside.1": "Emeritus is busily guarding the guild from the crab menace! You give him an affectionate pat for his hard work.",
  "MEEP.EmeritusOutside.2": "Emeritus gives you a big, slobbery kiss. You are now slightly sticky with Pepper Rex saliva. It smells like campfire.",
  "MEEP.EmeritusOutside.3": "Emeritus is noisily crunching on a crab. Mateo seems to have passed their crustacean hatred onwards.",
  "MEEP.EmeritusOutside.4": "Emeritus is slightly damp and covered in sand, which will probably be great for The Guild's wooden floors.",
  "MEEP.EmeritusOutside.5": "Emeritus seems to be leading a very happy life, eating crabs, taking naps, and getting affection from anyone who wanders by.",

  "MEEP.EmeritusInside.1": "Emeritus looks up at you expectantly, so you give him a little kiss on the snoot. The Pepper Rex wags his tail appreciatively at you!",
  "MEEP.EmeritusInside.2": "Emeritus has only nearly burned down The Guild once this week, which is probably a record of some kind.",
  "MEEP.EmeritusInside.3": "Emeritus is wiggling side to side, like he's dancing to the beat of his own tunes. Wiggle on, lizard bro.",
  "MEEP.EmeritusInside.4": "Emeritus' stuffed teddie is named Ducky, and he takes excellent care of her. In fact, he seems outright protective.",
  "MEEP.EmeritusInside.5": "Emeritus bumps his head against your legs as you approach. He can't hug you, on account of his stumpy legs, but he'll sure try!",

  "MEEP.EmeritusFarmhouse.1": "Emeritus sneezes a small fireball! You panic momentarily, but it's fine. For now.",
  "MEEP.EmeritusFarmhouse.2": "Emeritus smells like he got into the trash bin again.",
  "MEEP.EmeritusFarmhouse.3": "Emeritus tries to give you a hug with his stumpy limbs. You appreciate that he tries.",
  "MEEP.EmeritusFarmhouse.4": "Emeritus is doing an excellent job protecting the farmhouse from the crab menace.",
  "MEEP.EmeritusFarmhouse.5": "Emeritus hasn't burned anything down yet today, how nice!",
