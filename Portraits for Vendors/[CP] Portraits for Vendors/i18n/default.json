  "HatMouse.Beanie": "Me got hat for every head. Okay, poke?",
//The Hamster is a reference to Bijou from Hamtaro. She is from France in the English version (and apparently from Russia in the French version)
  "HatMouse.Hamster": "Bonjour! Looking for a chic hat today? Um... poke?",
  "HatMouse.Bow": "You want bow? Bow for hair? Maybe bow on hat?",
  "HatMouse.Dipper": "Solve mysteries, sell hats, all in day's poke.",
  "HatMouse.Flower": "Make you look pretty with right hat, poke!",
  "HatMouse.Goggles": "All hero need goggles, poke!",
  "HatMouse.Headband": "Want headband? Heh, not for sale, poke!",
  "HatMouse.Link": "-makes animated gestures-",
//Mouse Marlon's line is a reference to the real Marlon's own shop line in the Adventurer's Guild
  "HatMouse.Marlon": "In market for new hat, poke?",
  "HatMouse.Post": "No mail today so me sell hats, poke.",
  "HatMouse.Red": "-silently stares at you-",
  "HatMouse.Sailor": "Yesterday sail, today sell hats, tomorrow maybe fish.",
//Strawhat Mouse's line is a reference to Luffy from One Piece's catchphrase "I'm gonna be King of the Pirates"
  "HatMouse.Strawhat": "Buy hats, poke! Me gunna be King of the Hats!",
//This is a reference to the Wizard's introduction. The name is a Rasmodeus+Mouse wordplay
  "HatMouse.Wizard": "I am Rasmouseus… Seeker of the arcane truths.", 

// Lines for the Casino Vendor, highly disapproving of the farmer being there
  "CasinoVendor1.Default": "Oh, it's you. Here to do window shopping, I presume?",
  "CasinoVendor2.Default": "You do realize your gold has no value here, right?",
  "CasinoVendor3.Default": "We used to be more discerning about who receives a Club Card.",
  "CasinoVendor4.Default": "All items are for sale… So long as you earn them.",
  
// 1.6.0 update Lines for the alternate Casino Vendor, short and blunt. The second line is a wordplay referring to his blue skin and blue = sad. If you can't find similar wordplay in the language you're translating, maybe you can change it to just "Why am I blue? I don't know what you're talking about."
  "CasinoVendor1.Bouncer": "I look familiar? You're mistaken.",
  "CasinoVendor2.Bouncer": "Why am I blue? You're wrong. I'm actually quite happy.",
  "CasinoVendor3.Bouncer": "Got a Club Card? You're allowed in.",
  "CasinoVendor4.Bouncer": "All items can be bought with Qi Coins.",

// Line for the Traveling Merchant during Festival of Ice
  "TravelerIce": "Ah, the perfect backdrop for some of my rarest finds! Today only, friend.",
  
// Lines for the Raccoon. "Bobo" is what she calls you.

  "Raccoon2": "Want some seeds, bobo?",

  "Crow3": "Caawww!",
  "Crow4": "Caw-caw-caw!",  
  "Crow5": "Crawwk...",
  
// Lines for the Joja Cashiers, friendly but canned. "Join us and thrive" is a reference to JojaMart's "Join Us. Thrive" slogan so the awkwardness is intentional,

  "JojaCashier2": "Remember, as a JojaMart member, you get more for less!",
  "JojaCashier3": "Join us and thrive on our special offers for select items!",

  "DesertTrader3.Scholar": "Where I hailed, your coin is as sand in the wind. What treasure can you offer instead?",
  "DesertTrader2.Scholar": "Every artifact has a story, much like yourself.",
