    //Secret Notes
    "SecretNote.Clint.7": "It's a page from someone's diary...^^...There are only a few 'older' bachelors in town, and none of them are perfect! Harvey is really anxious and weak, but I know he would make a loyal and devoted husband. He likes coffee and pickles.^^Elliott is a bit foppish and melodramatic, but he does have a nice chin. He likes crab cakes and pomegranates.^^Shane is messy and anti-social. But I think his gruff exterior is a defense mechanism, insulating his softness from the world. He likes Beer, Pizza, and Pepper Poppers.^^Clint can be creepy sometimes but if you actually give him a chance, he's probably pretty sweet. He is stuck on Emily though. He likes Artichoke Dip and Fiddlehead Risotto.%revealtasteHarvey395%revealtasteHarvey342%revealtasteElliott732%revealtasteElliott637%revealtasteShane346%revealtasteShane206%revealtasteShane215%revealtasteClint605%revealtasteClint649",
