	//This document will be short. It will deal with exactly four cases for now - Alissa is married (and the relevant reactions to that), Corine is married (and Ezekiel's reaction to that), Ian is married (Sean's reaction), and a Bert reaction if Abigail is your housemate (below). Jeric and Flor do not have relevant interactions.
	//This is also only meant to deal with GiftGift dialogues - EarlyLines are dealt with in their respective section.
