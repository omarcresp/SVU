[size=4]Dwarven Pulverizer[/size]
Breaks down ore clusters into useful ore, allows you to recycle stone into useful products and can pulverize ore and gems into a fine powder that can be used to brew spirits and make potions.

[size=3]Automate Notes[/size]
Automate works out of the box, however Ore Clusters -> Ore -> Ore Dust requires some special considerion if you don't want all ore to become dust.  To improve compatability you have 2 options:
[list=1]
[*] Configuration Option to increase how many Ore are required to turn into Dust.  Combined with Chests Anywhere this allows you to ensure that Ore Clusters won't automatically turn into dust by setting the input Ore requirement to 7 or above and configuring an input and output chest.  If you enable this option the machine ready time and output number will scale with however many input ore are required (2 ore = double time, 10 ore = 10 times as long, etc).
[*] Configuration Option to disable Ore Dust recipes completely.  This works without Chests Anywhere, but means you won't be able to make Dwarven Spirits in the Still.
