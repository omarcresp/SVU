[center][size=6]Dwarven﻿﻿[/size][size=6] Expansion[/size][/center]
A recreation of my Dwarvish mod for Stardew Valley using the expanded modding features available in 1.6

[size=5]New Machines[/size]

[size=4]Dwarven Gem Polisher[/size]
Improves the quality of gems to increase their value.
Useful both to increase profit from gems found in the mines as well as to create better quality gems for higher quality jewelry.

[size=4]Dwarven Jewelry Making Machine[/size]
Turns gems or minerals and gold into fine jewelry.
Turns gemstones and minerals into an artisan good that can be sold for drasticly increased profits.

[size=4]Dwarven Pulverizer[/size]
Breaks down ore clusters into useful ore, allows you to recycle stone into useful products and can pulverize ore and gems into a fine powder that can be used to brew spirits and make potions.
[size=3]Automate Notes[/size]
Automate works out of the box, however Ore Clusters -> Ore -> Ore Dust requires some special considerion if you don't want all ore to become dust.  To improve compatability you have 2 options:
[list=1]
[*] Configuration Option to increase how many Ore are required to turn into Dust.  Combined with Chests Anywhere this allows you to ensure that Ore Clusters won't automatically turn into dust by setting the input Ore requirement to 7 or above and configuring an input and output chest.  If you enable this option the machine ready time and output number will scale with however many input ore are required (2 ore = double time, 10 ore = 10 times as long, etc).
[*] Configuration Option to disable Ore Dust recipes completely.  This works without Chests Anywhere, but means you won't be able to make Dwarven Spirits in the Still.
[/list]

[size=4]Dwarven Still[/size]
Brew dwarven spirits and infuse them with the magic of the earth using gem dust.

Functions like a Mill, with products being processed and retrieved for the following morning.

Each day it can simultaniously process:
Up to 100 Copper Bars
Up to 30 Iron Bars
Up to 10 Gold Bars
Up to 6 Iridium Bars
Up to 6 Radioactive Bars
Up to 32 Refined Quartz from regular Quartz

However this machine takes up a 5x5 area, so the primary gain is in the farmer's time to load and unload materials.
