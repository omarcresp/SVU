  "Mail Text 01": "Dear, @.^^Demetrius discovered a boarded-up room in the back of your farm cave while he was setting up his research specimens.^We've removed the boards from the doorway, but unfortunately the room is too bright to expand his experiment. Maybe you can make some use of that extra space!^^-Robin"
