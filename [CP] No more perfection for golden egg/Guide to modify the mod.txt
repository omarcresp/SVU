If you want to modify the mod because you think the egg never goes on sale, or the price seems excessive, here I explain how:

IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE THE PRICE:
1) Open the content.json file with your notepad
2) look for the line: "Price": 100000,
3) Modify the price to your liking :) 
4) Make sure the number ends with a comma

Examples of what prices should look like:
"Price": 100,
"Price": 999999,
"Price": 1,
"Price": 150000,

That's it! your egg has changed price!

IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE THE PROBABILITY OF APPEARANCE:
1) Open the content.json file with your notepad
2) look for the line: 
"Condition": "RANDOM 0.25 @addDailyLuck"
3) we will focus on the number 0.25

The number 0.25 represents the probability that the golden egg will appear, which in this case is 25% probability
The probability works like this:
1 = 100%
0.50 = 50%
0 = 0%

If you understand this, you should be able to easily change the probability of the egg spawning.

IF YOU DO NOT WANT DAILY LUCK TO AFFECT THE APPEARANCE OF THE EGG, DO THIS:
1) Open the content.json file with your notepad
2) Look for this line: 
"Condition": "RANDOM 0.25 @addDailyLuck"
3) Delete @addDailyLuck
4) Make sure the line of code looks like this:
"Condition": "RANDOM 0.25"

Done!
