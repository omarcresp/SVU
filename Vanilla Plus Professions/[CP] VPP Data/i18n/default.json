Some parrots even spend time with other animals or humans: the Gem Islanders have long been known for training parrots to assist with finding fruits and other small objects (which several pirates in the archipelago have adapted into finding gold pieces), and some cultures find that a parrot and its perch being kept inside housing for other domestic animals results in the animals feeling more at ease.",

Unusually, this species develops completely while in the egg and hatches as a fully-formed frog rather than a tadpole.
